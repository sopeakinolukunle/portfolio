        <h1>Engineering Ethics — Reflective Statement</h1>

        <article class="essay card">
            <h2>Responsibility, Safety, and the Human Impact of Engineering</h2>

            <p>
                As a future bioengineer, I believe the essence of ethical engineering is a continuous commitment to
                protecting people — patients, users, and communities — while balancing innovation and practicality.
                Engineering decisions influence safety, environmental outcomes, and social justice. Because technical
                choices scale, ethical reflection must be an integral part of the design process rather than an
                afterthought.
            </p>

            <p>
                Safety is the foundational concern. In biomedical contexts especially, mistakes can cause harm to
                individuals and erode trust in institutions. Consequently, I prioritize rigorous testing, transparent
                documentation, and conservative assumptions when sampling uncertain situations. These practices reduce
                the risk of harm and make systems auditable. In research settings, reproducible data pipelines and clear
                lab notes safeguard both scientific validity and patient-relevant results.
            </p>

            <p>
                Environmental and social impacts are equally important. Engineers must consider lifecycle effects,
                accessibility, and whether a solution benefits those who need it most. For instance, a device designed
                for clinical use should be affordable and maintainable in the contexts where it will be deployed —
                otherwise its positive technical performance may be meaningless. In my projects, sustainability
                influences material choices and manufacturing decisions (e.g., minimizing waste when 3D printing,
                choosing recyclable packaging).
            </p>

            <p>
                Legal and regulatory frameworks provide necessary guardrails, but ethical responsibility goes beyond
                compliance. The Therac-25 incidents from the 1980s teach a painful lesson: software, hardware, and
                organizational culture together determine safety. Software bugs combined with inadequate oversight and
                poor feedback loops caused catastrophic patient harm. From this case I take two lessons: one, build
                rigorous end-to-end testing and fail-safes; two, cultivate a culture where team members can raise
                concerns without fear. Ethics requires building systems and teams that detect and correct problems
                quickly.
            </p>

            <p>
                A second case I often reflect on is the broader societal distribution of harms and benefits. Engineering
                choices can inadvertently favor already-advantaged populations. For example, diagnostic tools trained
                primarily on data from limited populations may be less effective for others. To counteract this, I will
                push for diverse data, inclusive testing, and transparency about a technology's limitations. I also
                believe in documenting assumptions clearly so downstream users understand constraints.
            </p>

            <p>
                Practically, I apply ethics through several habits: (1) explicit risk assessment during design (who
                could be harmed and how), (2) iterative validation with domain experts and target users, (3) thorough
                documentation (so decisions are traceable), and (4) an emphasis on accessibility and sustainability. In
                team projects, I encourage responsibility-sharing: each member is accountable for safety checks in their
                domain, and we maintain a shared checklist before deployment.
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, ethics is personal. It shapes what I choose to work on and how I collaborate. I aspire to build
                tools that increase access to health-promoting technologies and to do so transparently. If faced with a
                tradeoff — e.g., a faster path to deployment but with uncertain risks — I will favor caution, user
                testing, and clearer communication. Ethical engineering means humility: admitting uncertainty, learning
                from mistakes, and centering the people who will use our inventions.
            </p>

            <p class="closing">
                Engineering offers powerful tools to improve lives. That power comes with a duty: design responsibly,
                document decisions, and listen to affected communities. I plan to carry these ethical commitments into
                every project I undertake.
