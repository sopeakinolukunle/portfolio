AI Content studio is a Claude-powered content creation platform I built during a Hackathon hosted by Claude Builder Club @ IU. The tool generates complete multi-channel marketing
campaigns—blogs, ads, social posts, and images—in under seconds.

📌 Overview
AI Content Studio enables marketing teams to produce consistent, personalized, and industry-specific content at scale. Powered entirely by Anthropic Claude, it learns brand 
voice, writing style, and visual identity, producing ready-to-publish content across formats.

📌 Problem It Solves
Marketing agencies like BluePeak, a fictional organization presnted by the Hackathon hosts, struggled with slow, manual content creation that took 8–10 hours per campaign. They 
also faced challenges with scalability, brand consistency, and personalization across industries. AI Content Studio reduces creation time to minutes while maintaining accuracy and 
brand coherence.
